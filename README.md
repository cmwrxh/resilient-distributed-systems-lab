# 🧪 Resilient Distributed Systems Lab

A living reliability engineering lab where systems observe themselves, run controlled failure experiments, and document learning automatically over time.

---

## 🌱 Why This Repository Exists

Distributed systems rarely fail in predictable ways. Reliability is not achieved by design alone — it comes from observation, experimentation, and iteration.

This lab is built to model that mindset by continuously generating:

- Daily reliability observations
- Weekly chaos engineering experiments
- Long-term engineering learning artifacts

Instead of static documentation, this repository grows into a historical record of how a system behaves, evolves, and improves.

## 🧠 What This Lab Demonstrates

### 🔍 Continuous Observability
The system automatically generates telemetry snapshots that capture reliability signals such as latency trends, error patterns, and service behavior.

---

### 📝 Automated Reliability Journaling
Daily reports summarize system status, observations, and actionable improvement opportunities.

---

### ⚡ Chaos Engineering
Weekly experiment logs simulate controlled failures to test system resilience and recovery behavior.

---

### 📚 Engineering Knowledge Preservation
All experiments, observations, and decisions are stored as structured artifacts to prevent knowledge loss.

---


---

## 🔄 How The Automation Works

### Daily
Generates:
- Metrics snapshot
- Reliability journal entry

### Weekly
Generates:
- Chaos experiment log
- Hypothesis and learning record

---

## 🛠 Engineering Philosophy

### Evidence Over Assumption
Reliability is validated through recorded system behavior.

### Failure As A Learning Tool
Controlled failure experiments help uncover hidden weaknesses.

### Automation As Documentation
Learning is captured automatically and consistently.

### Long-Term Thinking
System health is evaluated across time, not just at deployment.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

This lab is intentionally designed to evolve and may later include:

- Real monitoring integrations (Prometheus / Grafana)
- Incident postmortem automation
- Reliability score tracking
- Service-level objective validation
- Automated remediation experiments

---

## 📌 What This Project Represents

This repository is not just code — it is a reliability journal that answers:

> How does a distributed system actually behave, and what did we learn from it?
